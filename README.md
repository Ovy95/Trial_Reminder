# Trial_reminders

This is a simple app using Node, thought of the idea of when you forget to cancel "free" memberships when having to sign up with card details. An example of this is a well known delivery service who offer free membership then charge a year fee. Also has MessageBird API which allows you to send text messages the day before as well to remind you with the custom message you enter for both the email and text.  

Currently unfinished needs designing along with deloyment on a live site. Along with email and password for sendning the messages to be stored in an Enviroment.
