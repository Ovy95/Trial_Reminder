# Trial_reminders

This is a simple app using Node, thought of the idea of when you forget to cancel "free" memberships when having to sign up with card details. An example of this is a well known delivery service who offer free membership then charge a year fee. Also has MessageBird API which allows you to send text messages the day before as well to remind you with the custom message you enter for both the email and text. 

I used Node-Cron for scheduling the tasks for both the email and the sms messages. The date information is taken from the date picker on the form. Also I used the Destroy method which is in the Node-cron package to stop yearly email and sms messages. 

Currently unfinished needs designing along with deloyment on a live site.

Little fix ups and next stages for completion 

* Design CSS styling
* Deployment
* Testing to be added
